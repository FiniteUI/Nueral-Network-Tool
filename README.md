# Nueral-Network-Tool
This is a simple nueral network tool in python for creating and using small nueral networks. 

__NueralNetwork.py__ is the main script, with the code for creating and running the nueral network.
__NueralNetworkVisualizer.py__ is a visualizer for the nueral network, which draws it using TKinter.

__NueralNetworkTester.py__ is a test script which creates and runs a small nueral network to test the program. The nueral network built is meant to recognize
2x2 grid patters, and is based off the example in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILsA4nyG7I0).
